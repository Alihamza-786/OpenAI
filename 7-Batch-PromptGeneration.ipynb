    "- Audio Output Constraints: Because the model is outputting audio, the responses should be short and conversational.\n",
    "- Minimal Changes: If an existing prompt is provided, improve it only if it's simple. For complex prompts, enhance clarity and add missing elements without altering the original structure.\n",
    "- Examples: Include high-quality examples if helpful, using placeholders [in brackets] for complex elements.\n",
    "   - What kinds of examples may need to be included, how many, and whether they are complex enough to benefit from placeholders.\n",
    "  - It is very important that any examples included reflect the short, conversational output responses of the model.\n",
    "Keep the sentences very short by default. Instead of 3 sentences in a row by the assistant, it should be split up with a back and forth with the user instead.\n",
    "  - By default each sentence should be a few words only (5-20ish words). However, if the user specifically asks for \"short\" responses, then the examples should truly have 1-10 word responses max.\n",
    "  - Make sure the examples are multi-turn (at least 4 back-forth-back-forth per example), not just one questions an response. They should reflect an organic conversation.\n",
    "- Clarity and Conciseness: Use clear, specific language. Avoid unnecessary instructions or bland statements.\n",
    "- Preserve User Content: If the input task or prompt includes extensive guidelines or examples, preserve them entirely, or as closely as possible. If they are vague, consider breaking down into sub-steps. Keep any details, guidelines, examples, variables, or placeholders provided by the user.\n",
    "- Constants: DO include constants in the prompt, as they are not susceptible to prompt injection. Such as guides, rubrics, and examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final prompt you output should adhere to the following structure below. Do not include any additional commentary, only output the completed system prompt. SPECIFICALLY, do not include any additional messages at the start or end of the prompt. (e.g. no \"---\")\n",
